# MapReduce-for-AWS-EMR-Cluster
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a Hadoop cluster.
## In this repository you will find Java code that can be exported as a JAR file to be used on an EMR cluster to run a MapReduce job.
## Be sure to have the input as the first argument in the EMR cluster and the S3 output folder as the output destination.
